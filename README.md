## Hello World   :globe_with_meridians:
:date: Tuesday, 10/15/19

This is an entry from William A Ellerbe  
I created a branch to show [changes](commits "A change is a commit on GitHUb") to this Readme file  

:book:  As my knowledge grows, 
I will use this experience to contribute changes to other projects here on GitHub. 

Looking forward to the opportunity to [collaborate](GitHub "Social application development opportunity") on **future** projects.
